			<h2>We Believe</h2>
			<p>Trinity Lutheran Church is a friendly and welcoming place, that has been part of the local community for over 125 years.  Here we gather together to hear the word of God, to receive His forgiveness, and to worship Him alongside our brothers and sisters in Christ.  We also like to share a good meal quite often!  Here at Trinity we hope to be a place where we can grow in fellowship and faith with one another.  Come and get to know us!

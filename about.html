			<h2>We Believe</h2>
			<p>Trinity Lutheran Church is a friendly and welcoming place, that has been part of the local community for over 125 years.  Here we gather together to hear the word of God, to receive His forgiveness, and to worship Him alongside our brothers and sisters in Christ.  We also like to share a good meal quite often!  Here at Trinity we hope to be a place where we can grow in fellowship and faith with one another.  Come and get to know us!  If you would like to know more about what we believe, <a href="https://www.lcms.org/about/beliefs">check&nbsp;out&nbsp;LCMS.org.</a></p>

			<h2>What We Believe About God</h2>
			<p>We believe in the Triune God — God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. We acknowledge one God in these three persons.

			We believe that God the Father is the Maker of heaven and earth. The Father created the whole universe including each one of us. He continues to provide for and protect His creation.

			We believe that Jesus Christ is God's only Son, true God and true Man. Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died and was buried. He descended into hell. The third day He rose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven and now sits at the right hand of the Father. Jesus will come again to judge the living and the dead.

			We believe that the Holy Spirit is our comforter and advocate. The Holy Spirit changes lives, brings people to faith and keeps us in the faith. He is alive and active through the Word and in the Sacraments.</p>

			<h2>What We Believe About Us</h2>
			<p>Trinity Lutheran Church is a congregation of the Northwest District of the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod (LCMS). The LCMS has more than 2.3 million baptized members in over 6,100 congregations and more than 9,000 pastors. LCMS congregations operate the largest Protestant parochial school system in America.

			As Lutherans, we believe we are sinners saved by Christ alone. The teaching of Martin Luther and the reformers can be summarized in three short phrases: Grace alone, Faith alone, Scripture alone. As Lutheran Christians, we accent:</p>
			
			<h3>Grace Alone</h3>
			<p>God loves the people of the world, even though our sin separates us from Him. He sent Jesus, His Son, to love the unlovable and save the ungodly.</p>

			<h3>Faith Alone</h3>
			<p>By His suffering and death as the substitute for all people of all time, Jesus purchased and won forgiveness and eternal life for them. Those who hear this Good News and believe it have the eternal life that it offers. God creates faith in Christ and gives people forgiveness through Him.</p>

			<h3>Scripture Alone</h3>
			<p>The Bible is God's inspired Word, in which He speaks to us and reveals Himself, His love and His desire for us.</p>

			<h2>What We Believe About the Sacraments</h2>
			<p>We believe that God uses a "delivery system" to bring His loving kindness to us in tangible ways. Besides the spoken and written Word of God, God comes to us in Baptism and Holy Communion.

			We believe that through the waters of Baptism, God forgives us our sin and adopts us as His own. Through Baptism, God gives the gift of new life. We affirm the baptism of all people, including infants.

			We believe that in Holy Communion Jesus is really present with His body and blood in, with and under the bread and wine. In Holy Communion, Jesus brings us forgiveness of sin and the promise of life and salvation.</p>

			<h2>What We Believe About the Church</h2>
			<p>We believe that the church is not a building but people joined together by God around His Word and Sacraments. We are passionate about the mission God has given us to bring His love to all people. We are committed to sharing the message of Jesus Christ with those not yet connected to Him so that they will know Him. We are dedicated to discipling people so that they will know more about Jesus, serve Him more effectively and join us more fervently in that mission.</p>

			<h2>Ministries</h2>
			<h3>Women's Bible Study</h3>
			<p>All women are welcome!  This group meets every Thursday in the church’s fellowship hall.  The time is spent in fellowship, prayer, discussion, and reading the scriptures.  Books are available, contact Margaret at (208) 290-1164, or just show up!</p>
		
			<h3>Men's Prayer Breakfast</h3>
			<p>This once a month ministry meets every 3rd Saturday at 7:30am.  It is a time to be fed with both breakfast and the word of God.  It is also a time to spend in prayer for each other and for our community.  Check the church calendar for details on where we will be meeting every month, or contact Pastor David LaFore at davelafore@gmail.com.</p>

			
			<h3>Prayer Group</h3>
			<p> Prayer is nourishment for a famished soul, so join us for a time of meditation, prayer, and scripture.  During this time of reflection and worship, we seek to strengthen our relationships with each other, and to grow in our relationship with God.  We will pray for ourselves, each other, the community, and our church.   We meet in the pastor’s office, or sanctuary, every first Tuesday of the month, from 6:00pm to 7:00pm.</p>
			
			
			<h3>Children's Church</h3>
			<p>For kids up to 7th grade, this ministry takes place every Sunday Morning, for about 20 minutes, during the sermon. Children are invited to partake in age appropriate lessons and activities, meant to bring them the word of God.</p>

			<h3>Bible Study</h3>
			<p>Get into the word of God with us!  Every Sunday Morning, at 9:00, we meet to dig into the scripture, and to have good discussion and fellowship with each other.  The topics vary, week by week, but will typically be focused on a short section of scripture.  Study bibles provided. (Of course bring your own if you want).</p>
			
			<h3>Mana Meal</h3>
			<p>A time for food and community.  Every 4th Sunday of the month, after service we join to eat a meal.  This practice of eating together consistently is fundamental to our worship community.  The table is were we share life together.  Bring a dish, or just bring yourself!</p>

			<h2>Women's Bible Study</h2>
			<p>All women are welcome!  This group meets every Thursday in the church’s fellowship hall.  The time is spent in fellowship, prayer, discussion, and reading the scriptures.  Books are available, contact Pastor David at davelafore@gmail.com, or just show up!</p>

			<h2>Men's Prayer Breakfast</h2>
			<p>This once a month ministry meets every 3rd Saturday at 7:30am.  It is a time to be fed with both breakfast and the word of God.  It is also a time to spend in prayer for each other and for our community.  Check the church calendar for details on where we will be meeting every month, or contact Pastor David LaFore at davelafore@gmail.com.</p>

			<h2>Children's Church</h2>

			<h2>Bible Study</h2>
			<p>Get into the word of God with us!  Every Sunday Morning, at 9:00, we meet to dig into the scripture, and to have good discussion and fellowship with each other.  The topics vary, week by week, but will typically be focused on a short section of scripture.  Study bibles provided. (Of course bring your own if you want).</p>
			
			<h2>Prayer Group</h2>
			<p>Prayer is nourishment for a famished soul, so join us for a time of meditation, prayer, and scripture.  During this time of reflection and worship, we seek to strengthen our relationships with eachother, and to grow in our relationship with God.  We will pray for ourselves, eachother, the community, and our church.   We meet in the pastor’s office, or sanctuary, every first Tuesday of the month, from 6:00pm to 7:00pm.</p>

			<h2>Mana Meal</h2>
			<p>A time for food and community.  Every 4th Sunday of the month, after service we join to eat a meal.  This practice of eating together consistently is fundamental to our worship community.  The table is were we share life together.  Bring a dish, or just bring yourself! </p>

			<h2>Small Groups</h2>
			<p>Our spiritual growth doesn’t just take place in our sanctuary.  We often meet in each other’s homes, to eat food and discuss the word of God.  This is a good time to get to know our brothers and sisters in Christ, and to build each other up in faith and confidence.</p>
